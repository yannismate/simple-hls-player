# simple-hls-player
Simple HLS video player as an Electron CLI app using HLS.js

## Usage
`simple-hls-player.exe [--width=x] [--height=y] [--load-img=example.gif] --url=https://example.com/hls.m3u8`  
There is very few use cases for this application. I used it to pull external HLS steams into OBS more reliably than VLC or the built-in media source.
